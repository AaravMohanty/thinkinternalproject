Take the best that exists and make it better. When it doesn't exist, design it.” — Sir Henry Royce

All my life, I have been passionate about perfecting and optimizing everything around me and achieving the best results, in the simplest ways possible. This is why I am pursuing a B.S. in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, with a minor in Economics and certificates in Applications of Data Science, and Entrepreneurship & Innovation.

I’m especially focused on the intersection of supply chain and technology, where I’ve applied my skills in forecasting, systems optimization, and cross-functional collaboration. At Microsoft, I developed a predictive decommissioning model that enhanced capacity planning across global data centers. At Elanco, I optimized SAP Transportation Management processes to reduce cost and improve implementation speed.

I bring curiosity, analytical thinking, and a love for problem-solving to every project, always striving to simplify complexity, collaborate effectively, and deliver results. All this with the purpose of learning from others and working as a team to grow as a person and achieve our mutual objectives.

I believe the most impactful ideas live at the intersection of culture, technology, and human connection — and I’m building at that intersection every day.

As a founder, marketer, and strategist, I’m drawn to ideas that challenge the norm and bring people together — whether through live experiences, digital content, or innovative products. My background in Finance, Data Analytics, and Innovation Management gave me the toolkit. Launching real-world ventures taught me how to use it.

I’m especially passionate about the creator economy, digital marketing, early-stage startups, and the future of venture capital. I love working with people who aren’t afraid to take risks, move fast, and build things that matter.

Max Lee,https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlee170/,Integrated Business and Engineering,Management Consulting,PurdueTHINK Consulting,Max,Lee,https://linkedin.com/company/purduethink,purduethink,27171784.0,"I am an ambitious and motivated student at Purdue University, majoring in Integrated Business and Engineering (formerly Industrial Management) and minoring in Materials Science and Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025. My primary interests lie in technology or technology consulting industries, and I am actively pursuing opportunities to gain relevant experience in both fields.

I recently completed a position as a Product Development Intern at Avalanche Technology in Fremont, California. In this role, I contributed to the stress testing and development of next-generation MRAM devices for aerospace applications. My responsibilities included the continuous improvement of temperature stress testing procedures and the application of AI in product management and development.

My drive is rooted in a passion for technology, collaboration with peers, and a commitment to community service. There is no greater satisfaction for me than seeing a project come to fruition—whether it’s building a new computer, repairing cars, or organizing community volunteer events. The positive impact of my work on those around me motivates me to continually push my boundaries.

At Purdue, I strive to deepen my understanding of global issues, particularly those related to the automotive industry, such as fuel efficiency, vehicle safety, and the transition from traditional combustion engines to electric vehicles. Through my involvement in programs like Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP), I have gained valuable experience as both a team member and a leader. For instance, my VIP team worked on developing more effective cornering and braking strategies for an autonomous race vehicle with Autonomous Motorsports Purdue (AMP). Currently, I lead a VIP team utilizing drone and Lidar technology to assess structural damage to client facilities.

As a member of Larsen’s Leaders Academy (LLA), I have had the opportunity to engage with mentors from leading companies, gaining insights into how I can improve myself and gain valuable experience. I am eager to continue seeking opportunities, both within and beyond Purdue, that will help me grow as an innovator and collaborator.

Thank you for taking the time to read my summary. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or further inquiries.

I’m also passionate about stepping outside my comfort zone. This curiosity has led me to explore fields adjacent to my core studies, such as supply chain management. In addition, my international experience in countries like Singapore, India, Africa, and the US has given me a global perspective, enriching my ability to collaborate in diverse settings.
