We are redoing the landing page, keep the glass UI, black background with like a blue galaxy design that is dynamic and moves slowly, as in you can see all the small particles moving along slowly. Then on the bottom in large text write THINKed[In], and the text needs to flicker in when we land on the page, like a random flicker animation for it to appear. THe text needs to stretch all the way from left to right. and we have the logo and get started button in the top margin, but dont make the margin seperate from the screen, it should blend.
